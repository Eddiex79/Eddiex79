- 🎓 I've studied languages at Cruzeiro do Sul university, but when I
 finished my undergraduation after 3 long years in 2019 I saw that teaching it wasn't what I wanted to my all life.
 Now, my goal is studying until become a software or web developer.
 I've just enrroled at Estácio (Faculdade Estácio) University to study (Analise e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas)[https://estacio.br/cursos/graduacao/analise-e-desenvolvimento-de-sistemas]
